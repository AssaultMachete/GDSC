                <p>The problem of global warming poses an inevitable threat to the planet,
                    and it needs joint efforts to solve it.
                    Renewable energy is one of the main solutions to the problem of global warming, as it works to reduce greenhouse gases
                    Here are some ways that renewable energy can be used to solve the problem of global warming:

                <div><img src="icon/solar-panels.png" alt="error"></div>
                <p class="paragraph">Solar energy: Solar energy can be used to generate electricity and heat water,
                    and this reduces dependence on fossil fuels that cause greenhouse gas emissions.
                    Solar energy is renewable, clean and does not produce any emissions.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph"> Wind energy: Wind energy can be used to generate electricity,
                    and it is a clean, renewable energy source that produces no emissions.
                    Wind stations can be installed in places where strong and suitable winds are available.

                <p class="paragraph">Hydropower: Hydropower can be used to generate electricity using dams and hydroelectric stations.
                    It is a renewable and clean energy source and does not produce any emissions.
                </p>

                    which are renewable and clean energy sources that do not produce any emissions.

                <p class="paragraph">Reducing greenhouse gas emissions: 
                    It is possible to improve the efficiency of using fossil fuels and adopt environmental policies that encourage the use of renewable energy.
                    Electric cars and electric buses can be used instead of conventional cars that use petrol or diesel.

            <div class="footer">
                <p>By using renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced and the effects of climate change reduced. Thus,
                    the problem of global warming can be reduced and the planet healthy for future generations.
