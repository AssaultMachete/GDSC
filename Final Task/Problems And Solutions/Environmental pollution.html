            <div class="head"> 
                <p>The problem of environmental pollution can be solved by renewable energy by analyzing the main causes of pollution
                    and using available technologies to reduce them. Here are some detailed methods that can be used to solve the problem of
                    environmental pollution using renewable energy:

                <p class="paragraph">Solar energy: can be used to generate electricity and heat water in homes and factories, and this reduces the use of fossil fuels that cause harmful emissions.
                    Solar panels can be installed on roofs to generate electricity,
                and solar energy can also be used in remote areas that are difficult to reach with conventional electricity.</p>

            <div class="solve">
                <div><img src="icon/wind-farm.png" alt="error"></div>
                <p class="paragraph">Wind energy: the use of wind energy to convert it into clean and safe electrical energy. 
                    This is done by installing the energy that has been manufactured into the batteries.
                    Wind can also be used to generate electricity in remote and criminal areas.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="solve">
                <div><img src="icon/thermal.png" alt="error"></div>
                <p class="paragraph">Thermal Energy: Thermal energy from the earth can be used to heat water and generate electricity.
                    This is done by using ground fans to move the moist air and reduce the temperature,
                    after which the moist air is cooled and condensed, and electrical energy is generated by converting the resulting thermal energy.
                </p>

            <div class="solve">
                <div><img src="icon/bioenergy.png" alt="error"></div>
                <p class="paragraph">Bioenergy: Bioenergy from organic waste can be used to generate electricity and generate biofuels.
                    This is done by converting organic waste into bioenergy in microorganism reactors, 
                    and the resulting bioenergy can be used to generate electricity or produce biofuels.

                <p>By using these methods, it is possible to reduce the use of fossil fuels and reduce harmful emissions and thus reduce environmental pollution.
                    The use of renewable energy can also improve air quality and protect public health.
