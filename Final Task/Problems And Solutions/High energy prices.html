                <p>The world is currently facing great challenges in the field of energy, 
                    and among these challenges is the high price of energy and its high cost. To solve this problem, renewable energy can be used, which has many advantages that make it a sustainable and efficient option.
                    Here are some of the methods that can be used to solve the problem of high energy prices using renewable energy:
