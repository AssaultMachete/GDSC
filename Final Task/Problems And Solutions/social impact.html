                <p class="paragraph">  Improving access to energy: Investment in renewable energy can improve access to energy in local communities, 
                    as renewable energy systems can be installed in places that lack electricity and energy, and this can improve the daily lives of local residents.

                <p class="paragraph">Improving public health: Renewable energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves air, water and soil quality.
                    This can improve the overall health of local residents and reduce health costs.
