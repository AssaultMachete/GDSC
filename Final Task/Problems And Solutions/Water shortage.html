                <p class="paragraph">Solar desalination: Solar cells can be used to generate electricity and be used to desalinate fresh water from available sources,
                    such as groundwater or surface water. Various technologies can be used for desalination using solar energy, 
                    such as reverse pressure desalination or solar distillation.

                <p class="paragraph">Generating electricity from solar energy to operate desalination plants:
                    Solar cells can be used to generate electricity and use them to operate desalination plants. 
                    Different desalination technologies can be used in these plants, such as reverse pressure desalination technology.

                <p class="paragraph">Using wind energy to operate water pumps: 
                    Wind energy can be used to operate water pumps and pump water from available sources,
                    such as underground wells or surface water sources. Various technologies can be used to generate wind energy, such as wind turbines.
