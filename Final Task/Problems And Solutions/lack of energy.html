                <p>Several factors must be taken into account when choosing the appropriate method to solve the problem of energy shortage by using renewable energy,
                    such as the availability of available sources and the cost of investment, maintenance and operation.
                    Energy efficiency should also be improved and the use of modern and advanced technologies to generate renewable energy should be encouraged.
