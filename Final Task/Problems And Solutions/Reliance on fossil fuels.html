                <p>The problem of dependence on fossil fuels is one of the most important challenges facing the world today, 
                    as the use of fossil fuels leads to environmental environments and environmental industries and increases climate change.
                    Investing in renewable energy and moving to sustainable energy sources.
                    Here are some of the methods that can be used to solve the problem of dependence on biofuels:

                <p class="paragraph">Transition to renewable energy: Investing in renewable energy can help transition to clean and sustainable energy sources, such as solar, wind, water and geothermal.
                    These sources can be used to generate electricity and power many systems and devices.

                <p class="paragraph"> Reducing harmful emissions: Renewable energy reduces harmful emissions, 
                    such as greenhouse gases and small particulate matter, that cause harm to public health and the environment.
                    Renewable energy can be used to reduce emissions in many sectors, such as transportation, industry and agriculture.

                <p class="paragraph">Improving energy independence: Investment in renewable energy can improve energy independence, 
                    as renewable energy relies on renewable and local energy sources, 
                    and this reduces dependency on fossil fuels and improves energy security.
